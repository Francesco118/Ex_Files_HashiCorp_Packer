# HashiCorp Packer Example Repository
This repository contains example files and documentation for learning how to use HashiCorp Packer for automating the provisioning of on-premises servers. The course is available on Linkedin Learning.

## Introduction
HashiCorp Packer is an open-source tool that automates the creation of any type of machine image for multiple platforms. With Packer, you can create identical machine images for multiple platforms from a single source configuration.

This repository serves as a learning resource for understanding and practicing the basics of Packer configuration, building machine images, and integrating Packer into your infrastructure provisioning workflow.
